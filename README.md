# Elias Nieminen Curriculum Vitae 2020
This is a repository for my online curriculum vitae, which can be viewed [here](http://eliasnieminen.fi/cv). It is a very simple web page
that consists of an HTML index file, some necessary Bootstrap style sheets and a little bit of my own CSS-code. My goal was to create a
simple but informative curriculum vitae without forgetting the style aspects. Of course it also provides an insight on what I can do in
a matter of hours with pure HTML and CSS.

Currently the page is only in Finnish, but I'm planning to provide an English version of the page in the near future. Until then, feel
free to contact me through email: [elias.nieminen@tuni.fi](mailto:elias.nieminen@tuni.fi).
